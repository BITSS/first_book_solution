# Hands-on excercise: the birthday problem!

As an illustration lets write a report using the participants in this workshop to illustrate the famous [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem). 

>What is the probability that at least two people this room share the same birthday?

>There are `r n.pers` in this room. 

>Is it something like $\frac{`r n.pers`}{365} =$   `r round(n.pers/365 , 3)`?
